### WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOESN'T
- The app is not fully functional. In the code, we wrote the layout of the interface and the basic screen flow, trying to give a basic feeling of the usage.
- Even though we cannot really get the wifi-connection, unlocking, or notification work, this app can still be a "running prototype" for usability testing in the future.
- At several places we just add an image instead of a real view.


### RUN THE CODE
We do not have an android phone, unfortunately. But it is running well when using emulator Nexus 5X.

**To both of us, this is the very first Android Studio experience.So there might be many impropriate use in the code. But still, we learned a lot while building it:)
